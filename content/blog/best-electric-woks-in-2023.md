* Positive ratings: 90%

The Aroma Housewares AEW-306 Electric Wok with Tempered Glass Lid is a professional model that promises quick and even cooking abilities. Its good nonstick coating makes it easy to clean and it is also light and easy to maneuver.

Additionally, the cookbook is limited, and the wok is somewhat large and bulky.

##### Pros
