If you're looking for a suitable protective cover for your Apple Watch Series SE or 6/5/4 40mm, the 2 Pack Case with Tempered Glass Screen Protector from JZK might be worth considering. This protective cover offers good quality protection that fits snugly, prevents scratches, and prefers scratches on the cover rather than the watch face.

Furthermore, the screen protector may eventually show scratches and lose sensitivity around the edges, which contradicts the misleading advertisement about the glass material.

- Comes with 2 screen protectors
- Provides excellent protection for everyday use
- Made of hard plastic material
- Great quality
