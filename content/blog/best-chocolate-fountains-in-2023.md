* Positive ratings: 56%

Are you planning a party and considering the Chocolate Fountain Party Fountain as a fun addition to your dessert table? We highly suggest looking into other options. This fountain may have a mysterious black finish, but unfortunately, that's where the excitement ends. The cons far outweigh the pros, as customers have reported that the chocolate doesn't melt properly and cannot be kept melted consistently. The fountain's small size also makes it difficult for dipping, and the chocolate quality quickly becomes unappetizing. With poor construction quality, this product simply isn't worth the investment.

##### Pros
- None.

##### Cons
- Chocolate does not melt properly
- Not able to keep the chocolate melted
- The product is small and not good to use for dipping chocolate
- Chocolate becomes unappetizing
- Poor quality and cheaply made
- Not worth the money

#### Recommendation

If you're looking for an entertaining addition to your next event, a chocolate fountain can be a fun and delicious option. However, it's important to choose the right model to avoid disappointment. 

If you're hosting a large gathering, the Wilton Chocolate Pro Chocolate Fountain with 4 lb capacity could be a great choice. Despite some minor issues with consistency and noise levels, it's easy to use and clean, and has been popular among party-goers.

For smaller events, the Nostalgia Electric Chocolate Fondue Fountain (24 oz, 3-tier set) offers good value for money and is popular with kids. Although there have been some issues with shaking and leakage, it's generally easy to clean and produces an impressive dessert display.

If you're on a tight budget, the Nostalgia Electric Chocolate Fondue Fountain (8 oz, 3-tier set) may be suitable for you. While its size may not be suitable for larger gatherings, its affordability and portability make it a worthwhile option.

However, we advise avoiding the Chocolate Fountain Party Fountain as its poor construction quality and disappointing chocolate melt creates an unpleasant experience for customers.

Overall, if you follow instructions and have the right materials, a chocolate fountain can be a fun addition to your party, but be sure to choose a model that suits your needs.
