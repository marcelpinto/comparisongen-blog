#### Recommendation

After reviewing the products listed above, the best recommendation would be the SUPCASE Unicorn Beetle Pro for Apple Watch because it offers excellent protection for the watch and has a solid construction that can withstand physical activity and rough weather. It also provides additional screen protection and is suitable for rugged activities such as sports or manual labor. However, it may be bulky for some users and may not fit all wrist sizes or types. 

For Fitbit users, the amBand compatible band with a protective case provides excellent protection, but it may be expensive and have a bulky design with noticeable lettering. 

If you are looking for a cost-effective option for your Apple Watch, the Spigen Rugged Armor Pro case with band is a good choice but may not hold up as well over time and may not offer as much protection as other options. 

Overall, it's essential to consider the level of protection and durability you need and choose a band and protective case that meets your needs without sacrificing comfort or functionality.
