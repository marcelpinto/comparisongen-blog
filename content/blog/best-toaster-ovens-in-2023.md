* Positive ratings: 84%

Looking for a solution to prevent spillovers, gunk, and odors in your toaster oven? The TWO-PACK 100% Non-Stick 11" Toaster Oven Liner might just be the answer. This Teflon liner is designed specifically for toaster ovens and is dishwasher safe. Users have reported that the liner remains clean even after continuous use, making clean-up easier and extending the lifespan of their appliances. However, the product description may be misleading, as it only holds four slices of bread, not the advertised eight, and the liners come folded in half, creating creases that can be difficult to remove.

##### Pros
- The crumb/spill catcher remains pristine after continuous use for toasting and baking even after a few months.
- The pan liners make clean-up easier after multiple uses and can be rinsed in the sink.
- This bottom tray for a front-loading air fryer makes cleaning easy and extended the lifespan of the reviewer's air fryer.
- Using these items has helped to prolong the lifespan of the oven pan.

##### Cons
- The product description of a toaster oven is misleading as it barely holds four slices of bread, not 8.
- The liners are folded in half, making it challenging to remove the crease.
