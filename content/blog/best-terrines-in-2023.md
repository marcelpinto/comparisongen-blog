#### Recommendation

Based on the pros and cons listed for each terrine product, the Le Creuset Pate Terrine in Cherry (1.5 Qt) offers a comfortable and durable option. It is made with high-quality materials and provides good support. Additionally, its attractive design adds to its appeal. However, it is important to note that this product is more expensive compared to similar options, and the sizing may be confusing for some customers.

Alternatively, the Staub Terrine Small Rectangular in Black (15cm x 11cm) boasts a stunning and elegant design with a matte black finish and brass knob handle. It also comes with a multilingual instruction book and is suitable for those with a collection of different sizes. However, this terrine does not come with a press, which may require improvisation for certain recipes.

If you prefer a larger terrine, the Emile Henry France Ovenware Terrine & Press in Large (Burgundy) offers good quality and works well for making Terrine de Foie Gras. However, some users experienced issues with shipping, receiving a smaller size than described, or broken pieces upon arrival. Additionally, the press may get stuck in the terrine, limiting its usability for small quantities.

For a smaller terrine option, the Emile Henry France Ovenware Terrine & Press in Small (Flour White) is highly praised for the aesthetically pleasing result it produces, particularly for vegetable pate. The packaging and included recipe brochure also enhance the overall experience. However, some users found that the handles of the white and red terrines were prone to breaking, and the design of the terrine made it impractical to use or lift with an oven glove.

Based on these considerations, we recommend the Le Creuset Pate Terrine in Cherry (1.5 Qt) for its comfort, durability, and attractive design, despite its higher price point and potential confusion with sizing.
