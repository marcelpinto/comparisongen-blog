The Palmer Pizzelle Maker Classic is a beloved kitchen appliance that can help you create thin, crispy pizzelles in half the time it takes with traditional hand irons. Boasting 120 volts and 800 watts of power, this American-made pizzelle maker offers even heat distribution, making it easy to use and clean.

#### FineMade Pizzelle Maker with Non-Stick Coating, Electric Pizzelle Cookie Baker Press with Snowflake Pattern, Make Two 4 Inch Traditional Italian Waffle Cookies at Once, Recipe Included {#finemadepizzellemakerwithnonstickcoatingelectricpizzellecookiebakerpresswithsnowflakepatternmaketwo4inchtraditionalitalianwafflecookiesatoncerecipeincluded}



* Positive ratings: 79%

Introducing the FineMade Pizzelle Maker with Non-Stick Coating, the affordable and convenient electric pizzelle cookie baker press that allows for the customization of flavor. With an easy-to-use and clean non-stick feature, this device produces thin and delicious traditional Italian waffle cookies in no time. However, our comprehensive review reveals that while the end result is good, the heating element's uneven browning and lack of temperature control require constant attention to avoid burning. Additionally, its small size may be inconvenient for some, and determining the right amount of dough can be challenging. The uneven heat distribution also results in the lower bottom of the cookie burning, making it messier to use.

##### Pros

- Non-stick feature works well
- Makes nice thin pizzelle
- Affordable price
- Allows customization of flavor
- Good end result

##### Cons
- Heating element results in uneven browning
