#### Recommendation

After reviewing the various products, I would highly recommend the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Professional NV356E. With its powerful suction, long cord, and versatile attachments, it's great for both carpets and hard floors and especially effective in picking up pet hair. Although it can be heavy to carry and may get clogged easily, its performance outweighs these minor cons.

For a more budget-friendly option, the Dirt Devil Simpli-Stik Corded Bagless Stick Vacuum is a decent choice. It has good suction power and is lightweight and easy to maneuver, but it comes with a short cord and is prone to wear and tear.

Overall, it's worth investing in a high-quality vacuum cleaner like the Shark Navigator Lift-Away Professional NV356E for its long-term durability and effective cleaning capabilities.
