In contrast, the De'Longhi EC680M Espresso Machine and the Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Steam Espresso System with Milk Frother may have their drawbacks. The De'Longhi EC680M may struggle with durability, and the steaming wand may be too short or not effective. On the other hand, the Mr. Coffee 4-Cup Steam Espresso System with Milk Frother lacks advanced features and a well-designed steaming wand, and may be difficult to clean or maintain.
