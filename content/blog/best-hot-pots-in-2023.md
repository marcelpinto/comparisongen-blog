* Positive ratings: 87%

The Audecook Electric Hot Pot with Steamer 2L and Ceramic Glaze Non-Stick Frying Pan 8 Inch is a versatile and affordable option for those looking for a portable cooking solution. The white pot with ceramic glaze makes for easy cleaning, while the square electric skillet size accommodates larger foods and overlights eggs and bacon fried. Additionally, the electric skillet is easy to clean, comes with a long-handled spatula, and can replace the microwave and air fryer. However, users should be cautious with the cord while on high, as the electric pot may have some issues with uneven heating. Furthermore, difficulties cleaning the lid and pot of the little cookpot and the non-stick coating chipping easily are drawbacks. The little cookpot only has two heat settings, and avoiding getting water inside the plug or bottom section while cleaning could be annoying. The rice cooker has a nice hefty handle and is lightweight, with a steamer basket that works well, but there is no timer, and the poorly designed off/low/high switch may pose concerns for heavy use, and the lid having no place to rest.
