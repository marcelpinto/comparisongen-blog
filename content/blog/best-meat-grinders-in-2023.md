The NutriBullet Extractor Blade is a highly effective tool for making smoothies with even the toughest of ingredients. Its specialized blade design breaks up ingredients for smoother drinks, and replacement blades work just as well as the original. Plus, NutriBullet is superior to traditional blenders and works well with vegetables, all while being quieter than other blenders. However, the extractor's gasket cannot be fully cleaned and may grow black mold, and the NutriBullet requires periodic blade replacements. Third-party gaskets may also be necessary to prevent leaks and mold growth, and some users have had difficulty with re-installing the seal. The Nutribullet can also be less effective with blueberries and customer service may not always meet expectations.
