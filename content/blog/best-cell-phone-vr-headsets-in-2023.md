Looking for an affordable VR headset that's easy to set up and perfect for kids? Check out the Universal Virtual Reality Goggles, compatible with both iPhones and Androids. With decent 3D capabilities, these VR glasses offer a fun and interactive experience for children looking to explore virtual reality. However, for adults, be aware that the nose cavity is not designed for larger noses and the lens placement may cause "tunnel vision." Additionally, the controller can be difficult to navigate and there have been issues with blurry and one-sided views, as well as difficulties cleaning the lenses from the other side. Keep in mind that the headset is fragile and breaks easily. While not the highest quality VR headset on the market, it's a great option for families on a budget looking to dabble in virtual reality.

#### Pros
