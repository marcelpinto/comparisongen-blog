* Positive ratings: 89%

If you're a coffee or spice lover, the Mueller HyperGrind Precision Electric Spice/Coffee Grinder Mill may be worth your attention. This grinder is a powerful machine that's designed to make efficient grinding a breeze. With precision blades that allow for the perfect grind every time and a large grinding capacity, it's perfect for those who have a lot of coffee or spices to grind. However, there are a few cons to consider. The poor connection between the inner metal bowl and outer container can lead to powder shooting out, but the company will issue a replacement. Additionally, the loud operation may not suit those who prefer quiet mornings, and the cord can be difficult to store.

Nevertheless, the pros outweigh the cons, and the Mueller HyperGrind grinder is a fantastic addition to any kitchen.

##### Pros

- Loud grinding operation that limits its use in the morning if anyone is still sleeping

#### Corona Corn & Grain Mill with High Hopper {#coronacorngrainmillwithhighhopper}



* Positive ratings: 80%
