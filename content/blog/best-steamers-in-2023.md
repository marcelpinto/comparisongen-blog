Based on the pros and cons of the different steamer baskets and appliances, we have a few recommendations:

1. If you're looking for a multipurpose steamer basket that is sturdy and versatile, the Joyce Chen Bamboo Steamer is a great option. It is easy to use, durable, and provides excellent results. Plus, it comes with bonus items like chopsticks and a dipping sauce dish.

2. For those who prefer a more modern option, the Instant Pot Official Silicone Steamer Basket is worth considering. It is compatible with different pot sizes, easy to use, and cooks food quickly. However, some users found it to be less sturdy than expected.

3. If you're seeking a microwave steamer for single servings, the Microwave Steamer for Single Serving is a convenient choice. It is easy to use and clean, making it perfect for quick and easy meals. However, it may not be suitable for larger servings, and some users experienced a loose lid.

Consider your specific needs and preferences when choosing your steamer basket or appliance. Each option has its strengths, so pick the one that aligns with your cooking style and requirements.
