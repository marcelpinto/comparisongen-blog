The Oster Belgian Waffle Maker with Adjustable Temperature Control, Non-Stick Plates and Cool Touch Handle is a reliable kitchen appliance that delivers crispy waffles without burning them. This waffle maker has an adjustable temperature control that comes with a green light, indicating when it's ready. Another great feature of this waffle maker is that it can be stored vertically, taking up less space. While it delivers several benefits to users, it also has some disadvantages.

- It is difficult to make thicker waffles, as they come out thin.
- The lack of an ON/OFF button, timer, and flipper means that it requires a bit of experimentation with heat and cooking time.
- Single waffle makers require more time to make multiple waffles.
- The size of the waffle is a matter of personal preference.
