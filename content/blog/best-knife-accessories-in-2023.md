#### Recommendation

If you are looking for an effective and affordable knife sharpener, we recommend going for a 3-stage sharpener. It can do a great job at sharpening cheap kitchen knives, and leave a super sharp edge. Just keep in mind that it might damage expensive professional knives, so you need to be careful. Also, note that it requires patience for the best results.

For maintaining your wooden cutting boards and keeping them safe from moisture and stains, we recommend using John Boos Butcher Block Board Cream. It is easy to apply and quickly absorbed by the wood, enhancing its natural beauty. However, its scent may be overpowering for some people.

To create a protective layer on your butcher block, we recommend John Boos Mystery Butcher Block Oil. Although the "mystery" aspect may seem gimmicky, the oil is effective, easy to apply, and creates a protective barrier for your block.

If you want to take care of your cutting board comprehensively, you can go for the Boos Block Cutting Board Care Kit, which is effective and easy to use. However, it is pricey.

For maintaining your high-quality knives, we recommend using Hinoki Knife Oil. This oil is perfect in viscosity for easy application, quick-drying without leaving sticky residue, and repelling dust and fingerprints. 

If you're in the market for kitchen tools, we recommend a Mandoline Slicer, but keep in mind that the main cutting blade may not be very sharp, and pushing through blades can be difficult. Additionally, consider purchasing cut-resistant gloves separately.

To keep your kitchen organized, we recommend a Canvas Knife Roll for your knives and other kitchen tools. However, note that it may have shorter leather straps and bindings and may not provide enough space for your larger kitchen tools.

Lastly, if you?re a brownie lover, the Bakeware Buddy Brownie Knife can easily make clean cuts without sticking to the blade. However, the knife may break easily with excessive force, and it's smaller than expected.
