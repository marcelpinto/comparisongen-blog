#### Recommendation

After reviewing the products above, we recommend the Broan Trash Compactor Odor Control Disc for its easy installation, long-lasting odor control and effective performance. However, if you are in the market for a compact and powerful blender, the Compact and Powerful Blender is a good choice despite being difficult to clean. We suggest avoiding the Krushr Trash Compactor due to its poor packaging for the door, tricky bag placement, and it being significantly more expensive compared to other models. The Rectangular Compactor Bags are a good option for those looking for a perfect fit for their rectangular compactor, despite mixed reviews and possible flimsiness. The GE Profile UCG1680LSS 15" Built In Compactor has potential with its 1.4 cu. ft. capacity and automatic anti-jam feature, but without a list of pros and cons, we cannot make a recommendation.
